# Temperature-Controllled-Fan-using-Arduino-UNO
Creating a Embedded system project with Arduino UNO, DHT11 Temperature Sensor and a 5V DC Fan to demonstrate how to turn on Fan with changes in Temperature. This mainly a small demonstration of what it can be used in Large Scale Factory to maintain a Stable Temperature.
